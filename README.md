# im-services-manager
Wordpress services manager plugin for sites created by Imaginal Marketing Group


A simple Services custom post type with categories and custom meta. 
Use the shortcode [im-services category="sample-category" location="sample-location"] to output basic tables with prices and descriptions. Tables can be targeted by any combination of a #imst-sample-category ID and .im_service_table< class for easy CSS styling. Supports basic text descriptions for posts as well as categories. This plugin is currently dependent on the "Taxonomy Meta" Plugin which was included with this package.
